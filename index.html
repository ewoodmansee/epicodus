      <h2>TRAVEL: ONTARIO</h2>

        <p>Located <a href="./travel/index.html">here</a>.</p>
        <p>Our assignment was to pick a location that we wanted to travel to, and make a website about that. I chose <strong>Ontario</strong> for a number of reasons:</p>
        <ul class="bulletless">
          <li>I've been there before, and my personal experience allowed me to fill out the webpage faster than I would if I picked somewhere I never had been to before - say, Rome - and had to do some research.</li>
          <li>As it was a region instead of a single city, it offered a number of subjects that I could use to flesh out the page, and, thus, allow me to show off more of my coding.</li>
          <li>I actually did have plans to fly out to Ontario some time in Autumn, 2020. Things changed.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Coding elements used for this include:</p>
        <ol class="bulletless">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Located <a href="./kakapo/index.html">here</a>.</p>
        <p>This wasn't a class project: I just wanted to link to something else, and wanted a picture of a <em>kakapo</em> on this website as they're one of my favorite animals. Sometimes it just be like that.</p>

      <h2>LIVESTREAMS</h2>
      <p>I did not make these, but I wanted a collection of <strong>soothing livestreams</strong> to round out the columns.</p>

Due to Covid-19 my hair's a mess so I don't have any recent pictures of me...at least none that don't involve a hat + probably a mask. Before Covid-19, my hair was a fade: it's only now starting to grow out of a mullet. The struggle is real, guys. I really want to get a haircut, but I also really don't want to start the cycle again." class="veryroundimagecenter" width=150>

        After having been laid off due to...current events, I realized that I needed to do something drastic. If I stayed in my current track, I'd just get another job identical to the last: I needed a change. So I decided to try coding.

        Skills include vigorous banter, coming up with debatably witty filler text on a whim, and translating computer concepts into vague abstract analogies. One of my favorite colors is <span style="color:#f2a400;">orange</span>. I also enjoy drinking tea and miss eating takoyaki.
