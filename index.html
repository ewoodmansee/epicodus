        <p>Our assignment was to pick a location that we wanted to travel to, and make a website about that. I chose <strong>Ontario</strong> for a number of reasons:</p>
       <ul class="bulletless">
        <li>I've been there before, and my personal experience allowed me to fill out the webpage faster than I would if I picked somewhere I never had been to before - say, Rome - and had to do some research.</li>
        <li>As it was a region instead of a single city, it offered a number of subjects that I could use to flesh out the page, and, thus, allow me to show off more of my coding.</li>
        <li>I actually did have plans to fly out to Ontario some time in Autumn, 2020. Things changed.</li>
       </ul>
      <p>Coding elements used for this include:</p>
       <ol class="bulletless">
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>CSS</li>
       </ol>

      <h3>KAKAPO</h3>
      <center><img src="./kakapo/images/kakapo.jpg" class="roundimagecenter" alt="It's a picture of a kakapo, which is a fat, green, flightless parrot." width=250></center>
      <p>This doesn't actually exist yet: I just wanted a picture of a <em>kakapo</em> on this website. Why isn't a kakapo my Discord avatar? A mystery. Anyway, so, I might mock up a page about kakapos just to justify this existence. If not, please enjoy this flightless parrot. I decided to round the corners to show off, but also because I was starting to feel like I was overusing the round images.</p>

    <p><img src="./images/wp1982120.jpg" alt="It's a picture of a betta fish, which, for some reason, I've chosen as my Discord avatar. Due to Covid-19 my hair's a mess so I don't have any recent pictures of me...at least none that don't involve a hat + probably a mask. Before Covid-19, my hair was a fade: it's only now starting to grow out of a mullet. The struggle is real, guys. I really want to get a haircut, but I also really don't want to start the cycle again." class="roundimageleft" width=200>
    
    After getting laid off due to current events, I realized that I needed to do something drastic, something that could change my life for the better. Otherwise I'd be unemployed until spring. So I decided to try coding.

    Skills include vigorous banter, coming up with debatably witty filler text on a whim, and translating computer concepts into vague abstract analogies.
